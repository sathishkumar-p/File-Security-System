# File-Security-System

ABSTRACT

The issue of privacy of data is very paramount with each of us, especially for those who share their computers. Since, there is no room for error when it comes to protection of confidential files; the way in which the security can be provided to our files and applications becomes a matter of primary importance. This project proposes a system that provides two-level security to ones’ files and applications. The first level of security is provided by ones’ mobile phone which acts as a Bluetooth device. The second level of security is provided by the users’ personal security password. In addition to the two-level security, the system also uses AES algorithm for file encryption and decryption, which is proven to provide a higher level of security to the files. Therefore, the proposed system will be a simple, personalized, and effective method to secure the files and applications in the computers that are shared by multiple users.
